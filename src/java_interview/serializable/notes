serialVersionUID is used in real systems where Java objects are serialized for
caching, session replication, messaging, or file storage, and later deserialized after application redeployment or restart.
It is not used for REST or downstream APIs.

Add it ONLY if ALL are true:
    Class implements Serializable
    Object may be stored / cached / transferred
    Object may be read later (after restart or redeploy)
    ✔ Session objects
    ✔ Cache objects (Redis, Ehcache)
    ✔ DTOs used in Java serialization (legacy)
    ✔ Objects written to files
    ✔ Messaging objects (JMS / old Kafka usage)

    👉 Rule: If you see Serializable, add serialVersionUID.

❌ When you do NOT need it

❌ REST request/response DTOs
❌ JSON-only objects (Jackson)
❌ Database entities (JPA only)
❌ API models
❌ Microservice communication
