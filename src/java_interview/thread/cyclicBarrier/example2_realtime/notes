Performance Note:

Using a busy-wait loop (i.e., continuously checking if the elapsed time is enough) is not efficient and
    is generally avoided in production-level code. It's used here just to demonstrate the concept without using Thread.sleep().
In real-world applications, you'd likely use timers or scheduled tasks to handle this more efficiently.
